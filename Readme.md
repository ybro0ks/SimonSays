The Simon Memory Game
The Simon Memory Game is a browser-based re-creation of the classic electronic memory skill game first released in 1978 by Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison. 
Inspired by the arcade game Touch Me and named after the childhood game Simon Says, Simon challenges players to repeat an increasingly complex sequence of visual cues. The device uses four coloured buttons, each of which lights up to form a pattern. T
he player's goal is simple: repeat the pattern. But with each successful round, the game becomes faster and the sequence gets longer.







Game Description
Starting the Game
Click the START button to begin. The game status indicator (a light beneath the START button) changes from RED to GREEN. The game waits 3 seconds, then the first signal is shown.

Simon Flashes a Colour
One button flashes. The player must click the same coloured button to continue.

Sequence Builds
Simon repeats the first signal and adds one more. The player must now repeat both signals in the correct order.

Difficulty Increases
With each new round, Simon adds one more button to the sequence. The player must repeat the full pattern correctly to continue.

Speed Progression
After the 5th, 9th, and 13th signals in a round, the game automatically increases the speed of the sequence display.

Game Over Conditions
If the player presses the wrong button or takes longer than 5 seconds to respond, all four buttons flash five times. This indicates failure, and the game ends. The status indicator turns back to RED, and the player must press START to begin again.

Score Display
After each game, the number of correctly repeated signals is shown in the display to the right of the START button. The highest score achieved across all attempts is shown to the left.
